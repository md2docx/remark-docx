## Getting Started:

This template is based on [Turborepo Template](https://github.com/react18-tools/turborepo-template/). But this one is optimized for md2docx plugins. It includes pre-configured unit-tests, a lot of extra stuff provided by the turborepo-template is removed, and comes with dependencies and scripts optimized for md2docx plugin development.

To get started, simply click on the `"Use this template"` button to create a new repository based on this template, and install dependencies. Customize it according to your requirements for your next md2docx plugin.

For detailed instructions and a checklist, please refer to [TODO.md](./TODO.md).
